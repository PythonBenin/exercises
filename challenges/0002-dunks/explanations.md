# Dunks

This problem is about graph theory. The goal is to find the longest cycle in
a directed graph. Nodes are NBA players, and edges represent the fact that one
player has dunk on another.

To find cycles in a graph, a depth-first search can be used. The difficulty of
this problem is to find the longest cycle. So the standard depth-first search
algorithm has to to be extended to find all the cycles and select the longest.
