# Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT)

The main difficulty of the BWT is to efficiently sort the cyclic rotations
of the input string. Hopefully, there exists a $N log^{2} N$ to performs
this task. The articles below present this algorithm.

Take the time to understand them. It will be useful for the next challenge.
